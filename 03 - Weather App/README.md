2. Weather App

Make weather application which shows information for a 5 day period for a specific city (Input is city name).
Use this open API to get the information: https://openweathermap.org/api
You can use jQuery if you want to.
For the layout of the boxes use Flexbox.

The results should be displayed in five equal in size boxes (next to each other and centered on the page) 
with equally distributed remaining (white space) between them. 

Each box should contain the following information:
- City name + City country
- Date
- Current temp
- Weather Description
- Icon (optional)

When a box is clicked, it should change it's size to be twice as big as the rest of the boxes 
and should display the following additional information (initial info should be kept):
- Min/max temp
- Cloud
- Wind
- Humidity 
- Pressure

Clicking again should return the box to previous state.
