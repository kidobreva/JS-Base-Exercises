Methods of Array.prototype to be used: filter, map, sort, reduce, some, every, find, findIndex

At the end of the index-START.html file you will find two additional exercises. 
The first of them can be solved in more than one way, please provide at least two and try to refrain from directly using the Array.prototype.reverse() method.
